<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages shall be devoted to the description
of a process on Dry Collodion, which I believe to be at
once simple and effective. The experiments connected
with the perfection of this process have occupied my
leisure time for the space of two years or more, and
have been conducted with all the care of which I was
master. The constant repetition of them enables me to
say, that whoever will follow diligently the process step
by step, as detailed in this Pamphlet, must succeed
in producing pictures in every way such as could be
required by the most exacting critic.</p>

<p>The process is simple, clean, and expeditious; and
the resulting Negatives possess the exquisite softness
of Albumen, the brilliancy of the wet Collodion, and
the fine artistic texture of the Paper process.</p>

<p>To disarm criticism, and to make peace with my
fellow labourers in the art, I wish it to be understood
that I do not claim the use of Collodion, of
Gelatine, of Metagelatine, or of any of the Chemicals
used in the process&mdash;most of these have been employed
by others in various ways; I merely reserve
to myself the pleasure of placing in the hands of
Photographers a definite and simple plan by which
pictures may be taken on Dry Collodion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> issuing a second edition of the Dry Collodion
process, I would take occasion to remark, that after
some months' practical working, it has not been found
necessary to make any material alteration in the
process; success has usually attended the adoption of
it, and in those cases where good pictures have not
resulted, the failure has always been traced to the
use of a Collodion not suited to the process.</p>

<p>I cannot allow this opportunity to pass, without
thanking those gentlemen whose opinions possess
weight in matters photographic, for the very candid
manner in which they have tested the capabilities of
my process, and for the very flattering testimony

<p class="tdc"><i>From the Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>We have not merely examined the description given by Mr. Long of his
dry collodion process, but we have witnessed the results obtained by following
carefully his directions. It appears to us that, by it, a collodion plate may
be prepared at home, wrapped in paper, and packed in portmanteau; that we
may journey to Rome or Venice, then place our plate in the camera obscura,
and allow it for a few minutes to receive the luminous image; remove it in a
dark room; re-pack it and trouble ourselves no more about it until our return
to England; when, in the room in which it was prepared, we may witness the
magic process of development, and rejoice that we have, without much
labour, secured a picture of the Coliseum or of the Bridge of Sighs.</p>


<p class="tdc"><i>From the Journal of the Cambrian Archæological Association.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Photographic Process.</span>&mdash;Mr. Long, of the firm of Bland and
Long, Opticians, Fleet Street, has recently put forth a valuable pamphlet,
in the form of an essay on the dry collodion process. By means of this,
plates prepared weeks beforehand may be exposed to objects, and then
kept for weeks afterwards before they are developed, as he has proved it
himself on the Continent. The advantage of this process to travellers, and
especially to archæologists, is immense; because hitherto the main drawback
upon photography has been the trouble and expense of carrying chemicals,
tents, &amp;c. &amp;c., besides the camera, with its lenses, to the scene of operation.
Now, however, it will be sufficient to carry merely the camera, with a suitable
supply of plates prepared according to this process. The observer can then,
by merely exposing his plates, with the proper precautions, <i>bag</i> any number
of views per diem, and on his return home can develop them&mdash;or have them
developed&mdash;at leisure. If this process succeeds, it will have the effect of
splitting photography into two distinct branches&mdash;the <i>æsthetic</i>, and the
<i>practical</i>. The former will fall to the share of the intelligent observer, the
traveller, the man of taste, who will go and search for objects, combine them,
or use them, under the most favourable æsthetic circumstances, and then
will carry them home to be handed over to the man of practice. Once in his
hands, nothing will remain but to manipulate the plates according to the rules
of photographic science, by means of all the best appliances that a well fitted
laboratory can furnish. One branch will feed the other. One will be the
department of observation, of search, of taste, of beauty; the other will be
that of calm scientific development, of improvement, of preservation. One
man will be like the artist who paints; the other like the artist who
engraves. One will be like the author, the man who writes; the other like
the printer, the man who perpetuates. We recommend members to enquire
carefully about this new process; because if it becomes firmly established,
any archæologist moving about the Country may get views of churches,
castles, cromlechs, meini-hirion, seals, &amp;c. &amp;c., <i>usque ad satietatum</i>&mdash;we
had almost said <i>ad nauseam</i>; but that word can never be connected with
archæology! The upshot of this is,&mdash;"Read Mr. Long's pamphlet, and
set up a portable camera with his prepared plates, as we intend doing
ourselves!"</p>

<p>I commenced experimenting on the process of Mr. Long. The success I
have met with from the first has convinced me that that process will ere long
be generally adopted: the plates being easily and quickly prepared, and
keeping well, is a great advantage.</p>

<p>My tour of a fortnight's duration having ended, I returned to London, and
began developing (the dry plates). To my great delight, I found all Mr. Long
had said in favour of his process fully realized. Picture after picture (I took
twenty-eight) came out with great beauty, and so far as the process is concerned,
I have not had a single failure.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Letter from Robert Hunt, Esq., F.R.S., to the Editor of the London
Photographic Journal, October, 1857.</i></p>

<p class="tdr2">6, Green's Row, Chelsea.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is due to Mr. Long that I should state what my experience has
been with his dry collodion plates, and I feel much satisfaction in doing so,
being enabled fully to confirm all that Mr. Smith has said respecting the dry
plates prepared as he has described (Photo. Journ. Sept. 21). On the
26th of August, Mr. Long, at my request, furnished me with some of his dry
collodion plates. Absence from London, and the press of official engagements,
prevented my trying any experiments with those plates until the
30th of September. Although the weather was very unfavourable, the
result was superior to my expectations. On the 7th of October, at four in
the afternoon, when the sky was covered with clouds and the weather
stormy, I exposed a plate in the camera obscura for ten minutes to the dark
brick building, Chelsea Hospital. I enclose you a positive print from the
result of this experiment. When we remember that the sensitive plate had
been kept by me for a period of <i>forty-two days</i>, and then exposed under very
unfavourable circumstances, I think you will admit that the result is satisfactory.
I should not content myself with this trial, but that I am again
compelled to leave London for a long period, and I shall have no other
opportunity of testing these plates for this year. I feel convinced that the
traveller might with perfect safety use plates which have been prepared for a
month, and thus relieve himself from much labour and frequent annoyance,
by the use of Mr. Long's process.</p>

<p class="tdr2"><span class="smcap">Robert Hunt.</span></p>


<p class="tdc"><i>From the Illustrated London News, January 9, 1858.</i></p>

<p>It is but a few years since, when we heard with surprise, and some
incredulity, that light could be made to delineate images of external objects
upon chemically prepared tablets placed in the camera obscura,&mdash;now
photography stares us in the face at every corner,&mdash;that which was wonderful
has become familiar,&mdash;that which was mysterious is singularly common.</p>

<p>In cities, we see glass houses, on at least one roof in every street,&mdash;in
villages, caravans, with Brown and Jones, photographers, are regularly found,&mdash;on
the hills we discover the tent, and in the valleys the camera,&mdash;by the
river-side there is the mysterious head hidden in the dark curtains of a dark
box,&mdash;and upon the sea-shore the tripod-stand is securely fixed in the sands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and a biped is evidently focusing for the next fine ocean wave,&mdash;the sketcher
has fled to his own especial solitudes, and the photographer has usurped his
place.</p>

<p>It has been said of the most recent photographic processes, as was well said
of the octo-syllabic verse, that it possesses "unfortunate facilities." This is
true in many respects of the positive collodion process, by which the myriads
of sad reflections on humanity are perpetrated. Not so, however, is it with
the negative process, by which alone we can multiply the beautiful things
which the solar pencil traces with such fidelity. The labour attendant upon
a photographic tour is great, and real enthusiasm alone carries the amateur
forward. The camera obscura and the stand are a burden, and with the tent
and chemical box, they become a real load. Then there is the uncertainty
attendant upon the processes. We deal with the nicest chemical adjustments.
The balance is arranged with caution for a certain set of conditions,&mdash;alter
but one of these, and all goes wrong. We leave home in the morning, we
work in the dark all day, and we return jaded at night, to find we have
obtained&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Sensitive as the collodion process is, and charming as are the results, when
all goes on successfully, it has not hitherto been a process which can be
practised out of doors, without many extraordinary, expensive, and troublesome
appliances.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, with very much satisfaction that we have watched the
progress of the so-called "dry collodion processes." Nearly all the processes
that have been published,&mdash;the "gelatine,"&mdash;the "oxymel,"&mdash;the "glycerine,"
and others,&mdash;have much that is excellent in them; but it appears to us that
a dry collodion process devised by Mr. Long, of which he has recently
published a description, is more simple and effective than any other. We
have seen beautiful pictures obtained in Belgium upon plates prepared in
England, and which plates were brought to this country again before the
pictures were developed.</p>

<p>Any man may, previously to starting on his journey, prepare, or purchase
prepared, a stock of glass plates. Armed with these and his camera, he may
proceed to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansion tread.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And force a churlish soil for scanty bread;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="p0">or to that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;sea Cybele fresh from ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising with her tiara of proud towers,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and, resting on his way, he may adjust his camera and his plate, and in the
few minutes which, under any circumstances, he would spend in observation,
he secures a picture for future study,&mdash;a photograph to give him pleasure in
the quiet of his home.</p>

<p>Mr. Long has published a little treatise, with which we head this article,
and by following out the simple directions which he gives, all may succeed in
obtaining the important desideratum,&mdash;a parcel of highly sensitive plates,
which can be packed in paper and stowed away in a portmanteau, to be drawn
out as occasion may require, to be returned again to the same package
(without having any of the annoyances attendant upon a box of liquid
chemicals), and a plate which can be kept with its dormant picture quite
uninjured until the photographer, on his arrival home, at his perfect leisure,
in his own operating room, can develop the photograph which he has obtained.</p>

<p>Such are the facilities offered by this improvement, that we may expect
almost every traveller will avail himself of it, and thus secure for his own
portfolio, and the portfolios of his friends, views of scenes hallowed by their
historical association,&mdash;of ruins rendered sacred from the sacred memories
which still wrap them in their shadows, as the mantling ivy clothes their
crumbling walls.</p>

<h2><span class="vsmallnb">THE</span><br />

DRY COLLODION PROCESS.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> describing in detail the manipulations of the
process on Dry Collodion plates, it will be necessary
to say a few words on the materials and apparatus
to be employed, and also to give an account of the
means of preparing the various solutions used in the
process. First,</p>


<h3>THE COLLODION.</h3>

<p>This being the principal material we have to use,
we must exercise great care in the selection of a
sample that possesses all the characteristics which fit
it for a dry process. We must reject all samples
that possess great tenacity and contractile power: the
Collodion must not be too thick, and it must flow
evenly over the plate, and not set in ridges. The
best condition for the Iodized Collodion is that known
as <i>powdery</i>, that is, being spread on the plate and
partially dry, it cannot be removed as a film, but
crumbles up on being pressed by the finger in its
passage across the plate; in fact, such a condition as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would arise from using gun cotton prepared with
acids at a high temperature.</p>

<p>The following formula will be found to answer
most admirably:</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Gun Cotton</td>
  <td class="tdr">60</td>
  <td class="tdl">grains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Absolute Alcohol</td>
  <td class="tdr">5</td>
  <td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Sulphuric Æther, sp. gr. ·730&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">15</td>
  <td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The cotton is to be shaken up with the mixture of
alcohol and æther, and when dissolved, the bottle
containing it must be stood aside, in order that any
undissolved particles of cotton may subside. The
clear liquid may then be decanted into a clean bottle
for use.</p>

<p>It will be as well to test the quality of the Collodion
thus prepared before coating any number of plates
with it, for, although the above proportions are very
excellent, some little latitude must be allowed for
the different degrees of solubility of the various
samples of cotton used from time to time. The film,
when spread, on the glass plate and partially dry,
should not be capable of being removed in the form
of a skin, but should give before the finger and
crumble up on its being rubbed across the plate.</p>

<p>Should any difficulty, however, occur, it would be
better to obtain a sample of the Collodion made by
an experienced hand, in order that a fair trial may
be given to the process. If the Collodion be too
contractile it will give rise to blisters in the film, and
will wash off the plate during development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Iodizing</span> Solution that I have found to give
the best results in this process is made in the manner
following:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Absolute Alcohol</td>
  <td class="tdr">8</td>
  <td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Iodide of Cadmium</td>
  <td class="tdr">64</td>
  <td class="tdl">grains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Iodide of Ammonium</td>
  <td class="tdr">64</td>
  <td class="tdl">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The iodides are to be dissolved by agitation in the
alcohol, and the resulting solution is to be carefully
filtered, and preserved in a well stoppered bottle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Iodized Collodion</span> consists of&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Iodizing Solution</td>
  <td class="tdr">2 drams</td>
  <td class="tdr" rowspan="2"><span style="font-size: 1.8em;">}</span></td>

<p>The Collodion should always be iodized at least
twelve hours before it is required; this interval
allows any insoluble matters either from the iodizing
solution or from the Collodion itself to fall to the
bottom, and enables the operator to pour off the
clear solution into a perfectly clean bottle for use.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the Iodized Collodion comes</p>


<h3>THE PRESERVATIVE SOLUTION.</h3>

<p>Some care is required in the preparation of this
solution, in order that it may be clear and bright
when finished, and not contain particles that would
be deposited in its passage over the Collodion film
when being used. The chief precaution to be observed
is <i>not to allow it to boil too rapidly, and not to
conduct the operation over too fierce a fire;</i> attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to this will prevent many failures, and ensure a
solution in every way suited for the process.</p>

<p>Take one ounce of the best transparent gelatine, and
throw it into a pipkin in which has been previously
placed one pint of distilled water; set this on a slow
fire, or over a lamp, until the gelatine is completely
melted; then weigh out half ounce of pure citric
acid and dissolve it in two ounces of distilled water;
add this to the solution of gelatine, stirring it during
the addition with a glass rod. The solution in the
pipkin is now to be gently boiled for about half an
hour: remove it from the fire, and add sufficient
distilled water to make up the bulk of liquid to
one pint. When quite cold, the liquid in the pipkin
is to be filtered through two thicknesses of pure
white blotting paper into a bottle perfectly dry and
clean. We now add to every pint of filtered
preservative solution, two ounces of alcohol of the
specific gravity of ·840.</p>

<p>The solution thus prepared is ready for use, and
should be of a pale amber colour, without any signs of
insoluble particles floating in it; should any appear
after it has been prepared for some days, a second
filtration will remove them, and render the liquid again
bright and clear.</p>

<p>It will be found better to prepare this solution only
in the quantity indicated above, unless the consumption
be large, for, although it will keep good for a month
or more, my experience points to the fact, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
most successful results follow the use of Preservative
Solution freshly prepared.</p>


<h3>THE NITRATE OF SILVER BATH.</h3>

<p>The bath for rendering the plates sensitive does not
differ from that recommended for taking negatives with
wet Collodion. The formula for its preparation may
not be out of place, however, and may assist those
whose knowledge of the matter is not perfect.</p>

<p>Dissolve the nitrate of silver in half the water and
then add the iodide of cadmium; thoroughly agitate
the mixture for five or ten minutes, then add ½ ounce
of alcohol, sp. gr. ·840, and fill up with the remaining
half of the distilled water; further agitation, and
subsequent filtration through two thicknesses of white
bibulous paper, will put us in possession of a negative
bath. The nitrate of silver being fused, and consequently,
pure and neutral, and as it is essential to
obtain clean pictures that the bath should be slightly
acid in its reaction, we find it necessary to add 5 or 6
minims or drops of pure glacial acetic acid to a bath
of 20 ounces, in order that the above condition may
obtain.</p>


<h3>THE DEVELOPING SOLUTION</h3>

<p>Is very simple in its nature, being merely a saturated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
solution of gallic acid in distilled water, to which
has been added a small proportion of alcohol of
sp. gr. ·840.</p>

<p>The exact formula is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">

  <td class="tdl">Distilled Water</td>

  <td class="tdl">Gallic Acid</td>
  <td class="tdr">½</td>
  <td class="tdl">ounce.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The gallic acid will not be entirely dissolved, but
that left at the bottom of the bottle will ensure the
solution being saturated; it is better not to filter the
developing solution until it is required for use, as it
is preferable to allow it to stand over an excess of
gallic acid, than for it to be withdrawn after a slight
agitation with the crystals; it is a great error to suppose
that we obtain a saturated solution of gallic acid by
merely agitating the crystals with water for a few
moments.</p>

<p>The developing solution prepared as above directed
will keep good and in working order for some weeks,
but when it becomes of a dark color, it would be safer
to reject it and prepare a fresh quantity than to run
the risk of a failure from an impure and imperfect
developing agent.</p>

<p class="caption2"><b>THE MANIPULATION.</b></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The process of obtaining a picture on Dry Collodion
plates is in itself a most simple and easy matter, but
there are one or two precautions that appear necessary
to ensure success that cannot be lightly neglected.
In the first place, it is absolutely certain, that if we
want a clean and bright picture, we must have a plate
perfectly free from all extraneous matters, such as
soap, grease, &amp;c. Various plans for cleaning the
glass plate have been proposed, all more or less
successful, but in most of them there is one great fault,
namely, that of using a powder, as tripoli, rotten-stone,
&amp;c. to rub off the dirt with. Now we find that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
practice this will not answer, from the almost impossibility
of getting rid of the floating particles of the
powder when the plate is rendered slightly electrical
by rubbing, and as each of these particles if it become
enveloped in the Collodion film, would produce a spot
on the finished picture, we find it necessary to search
in another direction for a detergent for the glass plate
to which this objection would not apply. One soon
presents itself in the form of <i>old waste Collodion</i>&mdash;this
spread on the glass plate and rubbed off again
with cotton wool, makes the best and most perfect
cleanser hitherto proposed, without any of the objections
usually appended to other materials used for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>The next precaution necessary to be observed is,
that all the solutions should be perfectly bright and
clear; they should be absolutely free from floating
particles of any kind. This is essential, as it is
impossible to obtain clean pictures without attention
to it; the floating bodies in the solution settle on the
plate, and form so many nuclei, around which, in the
development of the picture, the silver is deposited in
an opaque mass, forming spots and blemishes on the
surface of the plate.</p>

<p>There is one precaution that cannot be dispensed
with, and that is, to be sure that the chemicals
employed are of absolute purity; without this, success
is very problematical, and vexation and disgust the
sure reward of its neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The process may for convenience be divided into
the following stages:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p4">
1.&mdash;Cleaning the plate.<br />
2.&mdash;Coating it with Collodion.<br />
3.&mdash;Rendering the plate sensitive.<br />
4.&mdash;Applying the Preservative solution.<br />
5.&mdash;Exposure in the camera.<br />
6.&mdash;Development of the picture.<br />
7.&mdash;Fixing the developed image.<br />
8.&mdash;Varnishing the finished negative.<br />

<h3>CLEANING THE PLATE.</h3>

<div id="Fig_1" class="fig_center" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/fig1.png" width="427" height="314" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Fig. 1.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The glass plate is first to be thoroughly washed
with an abundance of water, and dried on clean
cloths; it is then to be placed in the plate holder
(<a href="#Fig_1"><i>Fig. 1</i></a>), and have poured over its upper side a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
small quantity of old Collodion. Now take a tuft of
cotton wool and rub the Collodion all over the plate,
giving the hand a circular motion at the time: keep
rubbing until the Collodion is very nearly dry, then
turn the plate in the holder and repeat the same
treatment with the opposite side; then lean the plate
thus treated against a wall, while another, or any
number are put through this stage. When a sufficient
number have been so far cleaned, the plate holder
is to be carefully wiped, and the first plate&mdash;the
edges of which have also been carefully wiped with
a <i>clean</i> cloth&mdash;is to be replaced, and treated with a
smart rubbing with a wash leather, the operator at
intervals gently breathing on the plate. Both sides
of the plate being cleaned in this way, it may be
removed, after again wiping the edges carefully, to
the plate box, to await the subsequent steps of the
process. Plates cleaned in this manner should look
perfectly transparent, and free from any marks of the
cloth or leather, and when breathed upon should
condense the moisture of the breath in one uniform
degree over the whole surface. If patches of uneven
condensation appear, a repetition of the process must
be had recourse to.</p>

<p>The plate being clean, we proceed to the next step,</p>


<h3>COATING THE PLATE.</h3>

<p>Lay a piece of clean blotting paper on the table,
larger than the plate we are about to use; place the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
clean plate on this, and then bring the pneumatic
plate holder to bear on the centre of the glass,
making sure that it has laid hold firmly. We then
raise the plate with the left hand, and bring the
surface upwards which was previously on the blotting
paper; it will no doubt be found that small particles
of dust have attached themselves to the plate, these
must be removed by a broad and soft camel's hair
brush, kept for this purpose only.</p>

<div id="Fig_2" class="fig_center" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="472" height="365" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Fig. 2.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The Collodion is then to be poured on, as shown
in the diagram (<a href="#Fig_2"><i>Fig. 2</i></a>), and the superfluous quantity
returned to the bottle from one of the corners of the
plate. It does not matter which of the corners is
used for this purpose, that which is most convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to the operator assuming the preference. If the
Collodion should have a tendency to set in ridges
across the plate, a rocking motion, while the delivery
corner is in the mouth of the bottle, may be given
to it, still keeping the plate in a vertical plane.
This will restore the film to perfect evenness and
freedom from irregularity of any sort. The plate
should be held in the vertical position for a few
moments before being placed on the dipper to undergo
the next operation of</p>


<h3>RENDERING THE PLATE SENSITIVE.</h3>

<div id="Fig_3" class="fig_center" style="width: 208px;">
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="208" height="219" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Fig. 3.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The plate being placed, coated side outwards, on
the dipper, is to be plunged without hesitation into
the nitrate of silver bath (<a href="#Fig_3"><i>Fig. 3</i></a>). This must be
done without stopping, otherwise a line across the
plate will indicate, on development, the position of the
plate in the bath at the time this stoppage took
place; so that if we were to immerse the plate by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
series of jerks, we should have as a result, so many
bands of unequal development in the finished picture;
showing the importance of plunging the plate into
the bath without any stoppage during its descent.</p>

<div id="Fig_4" class="fig_center" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="492" height="303" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Fig. 4.</i></div>
</div>

<p>When the plate has rested for half a minute in
the bath, it may be withdrawn, and quickly re-immersed.
This washing must be continued at
intervals, until the greasy appearance goes off, generally
for the space of two minutes, when the plate
is to be taken out of the bath and placed with its
lower edge on a pad of blotting paper, in a position
as shown in the cut (<a href="#Fig_4"><i>Fig. 4.</i></a>) A fragment of
blotting paper is then to be used to absorb the
moisture from the back of the plate, and a pneumatic
plate holder&mdash;which should only be used for this
purpose&mdash;is applied to it to form a support while</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>APPLYING THE PRESERVATIVE SOLUTION.</h3>

<div id="Fig_5" class="fig_center" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/fig5.png" width="420" height="337" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Fig. 5.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Taking the plate in the left hand by means of the
pneumatic holder, incline it as shown in the diagram
(<a href="#Fig_5"><i>Fig. 5</i></a>); then having poured into a perfectly clean
measure rather more of the preservative solution than
is necessary to cover the plate twice,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> pour half of it
along the upper edge (A B) in such a manner, that a
wave of the solution may flow uniformly from one end
of the plate to the other; allow this to flow off into the
waste pan or sink, and then bring the plate to the
horizontal position, and pour on the remainder of
the preservative solution, eight times at least, allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
it to flow back into the measure from each corner
in succession, in order that the whole plate may be
brought uniformly under its influence. The plate is to
be again placed on a piece of clean blotting paper (as
shown at <a href="#Fig_4"><i>Fig. 4</i></a>), and its back once more wiped with
a fragment of blotting or papier Joseph, in order to
remove any of the preservative solution that may
have run from the surface to the underside in the
previous operation. The plate thus preserved is to
be reared on a piece of blotting paper with its face
against the wall until dry, and is then to be stowed
away in a plate box, perfectly light-tight to await the</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> A plate, 9 inches by 7, takes about 1 ounce of solution.</p></div>


<h3>EXPOSURE IN THE CAMERA.</h3>

<p>Collodion plates preserved as above directed, will
keep perfectly good and sensitive for 12 months at least;
and from the appearance of the developed image on
a plate that has been kept that time, I see at present
no reason why, if preserved from the damp, they would
not keep indefinitely. In my experiments, I have
never found the least difference in sensitiveness,
whether the plate be used within a few hours of the
time of its preparation, or has been kept for months;
until, however, we have had more experience in the
matter, it would be safer not to rely on plates more
than 12 months old.</p>

<p>The time of exposure in the camera, of course varies
in this process, under the same circumstances as it does
with the wet Collodion; but I have found as a general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rule, that it is better to give the plate a full exposure
than to fall into the opposite extreme: that is to say,
it is preferable to expose the plate sufficient time for
the deepest shadows to make an impression than to
close the dark slide at an earlier period, the mode of
development allowing considerable latitude in this
particular. With a 3-inch single lens, 16-inch focus,
with a ½-inch stop, the usual time for a bright
landscape will be about 5 minutes; this of course is
merely an approximation to the time of exposure,
the exact time can only be arrived at by experience.
I do not think I can do better than follow the
plan adopted in my "Practical Photography," of
giving instances of under and over exposure, as a
means of educating the tyro in the appearances
that result from these conditions of the plate.</p>

<p>If the exposure has been of too short duration,
the image will come out under the developing
solution with difficulty; and after a continued immersion
in it will only present the high lights, the
deep shadows not being represented, or, if so, in so
faint a manner as to be useless in the picture.</p>

<p>An over exposed plate, when treated with the
developing solution, will almost immediately give
indications of the picture; and in a few minutes,
the whole of the picture, <i>deep shadows and all</i>, will
come put in unnatural force; on looking through
the picture thus produced, we shall observe a great
flatness in it, there is a want of contrast between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
various parts, and although by continuing the development
we might obtain a tolerably intense
negative, the resulting picture would be flat, meagre,
and unsatisfactory: on the contrary, a plate that has
been exposed for the correct time, will comport
itself very differently under development from the
foregoing.</p>

<p>The sky and high lights will first appear, then
the half tones, and lastly, the parts of the picture
that were in deep shadow will show themselves;
this effect should take place in about five minutes
from the time of immersion in the developing bath:
a picture that comes out sooner than this, is, as a
general rule, over exposed; and one that is much
after the five minutes before it makes its appearance,
may be considered as under exposed.</p>

<p>We trust that the above instances may be of service
in indicating the average time required for an exposure
of the plate, but we must ask the reader not to take
the figures given as actual values, but merely as very
close approximations to the truth. We will imagine
the plate to have been properly exposed, and
proceed to</p>


<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PICTURE.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary that the picture should be
developed immediately after exposure in the camera;
any time that is convenient to the operator may
intervene between the processes, provided the aggregate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
time before and after exposure does not exceed
the limits of keeping power of the plate.</p>

<p>The development of the picture may be conducted
in two ways, either by immersing the plate in baths or
dishes, or by placing it on the levelling stand and
treating it with the solutions, in their proper order, as
detailed below. Each plan possesses certain advantages,
but it is of little consequence which one is
followed. Perhaps there is less danger of the film
washing off if the plate be treated on the levelling
stand, and on the other side with large plates it is more
difficult to cover them evenly with the developing
solution than it is simply to immerse them in a pan of
solution. We say to the reader, try both ways, and
make your own selection.</p>

<p>The plate upon being removed from the camera is
placed face upwards in a porcelain or glass dish of a
convenient size (not too large), and sufficient distilled
water is to be poured over it to cover the surface
thoroughly&mdash;this is for the purpose of softening the
preservative solution, and must be allowed to remain
on the plate for five minutes; the plate is then to be
lifted in and out of the water by means of the silver
hook. This done, remove the plate to a perfectly
clean dish, and pour carefully over it the developing
solution, composed of</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Saturated Solution of Gallic Acid (<a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>)</td>
  <td class="tdr">8</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes the picture will begin to make
its appearance, and will gradually unfold its details
under the influence of the developer, until the whole
of them are apparent; on raising the plate, however,
when this stage of development is reached, and
viewing it by transmitted light, the picture will
appear weak and poor; we must now remove the
plate from the bath, and add 2 drams more of the
nitrate silver solution, and having thoroughly mixed it
with the gallic acid already in the dish, we return the
partially developed plate, which in the course of a few
minutes will have acquired a great amount of intensity,&mdash;the
exact degree can be regulated by the time of
immersion: when the picture appears sufficiently intense,
it is to be removed from the developing dish, and
a gentle stream of water is poured over it, in order to
remove any adhering developing solution, and stop all
further reducing action on it.</p>

<p>During the whole time of the development, the
gallic acid should remain quite clear; it will become
slightly discoloured before the end of the development,
but it ought not at any time to become muddy,
or it will deposit a sort of sandy sediment on the
surface of the plate, which cannot be removed by
subsequent washing.</p>

<p>The usual time occupied in the development of
a successful picture is from 20 to 30 minutes, it
might be developed much quicker by using pyrogallic
acid, but at present I give the preference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
developer I have described, as I believe it to be
more certain, and more under the control of the
operator than the pyrogallic acid; and further,
as it is not necessary to watch the development
all the time it is going on, there can be very little
saving of time in the more rapid method of bringing
out the latent picture.</p>

<p>The picture being washed free from the adhering
developing solution, is to be placed on the levelling
stand, and subjected to the seventh part of the
process&mdash;</p>


<h3>FIXING THE DEVELOPED IMAGE.</h3>

<p>This is accomplished by pouring over the surface
of the plate sufficient solution of hyposulphite of
soda (p. 15) to thoroughly cover it, this will dissolve
out the unaltered iodide of silver, and give us a clear
and bright picture, in which the deep shadows should
be as transparent as the glass itself, and the high
lights as dense as a piece of metal, the intermediate
tones assuming their proper positions according to
the intensity of the light that was concerned in their
formation.</p>

<p>When the whole of the yellow iodide of silver is
removed, the fixing solution may be thrown off, and
the plate must be treated with an abundance of water;
too much cannot well be given at this stage, as the
hyposulphite adheres with great tenacity to the plate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
even after a good washing. The back of the plate
must be washed as well as the front, for I have
found that a neglect of this precaution has ruined
many a fine negative; the hyposulphite remaining at
the back finding its way by capillary attraction to
the surface, and once there, its destructive qualities
are sure, sooner or later, to render themselves
evident.</p>

<p>The picture being thoroughly washed, and either
dried spontaneously or by the fire, has only to be
covered with a film of varnish. And now comes the
last operation, of</p>


<h3>VARNISHING THE FINISHED NEGATIVE.</h3>

<p>Benzoin varnish is the best coating that can be
given to a Collodion negative. It resists the action
of pieces of grit; it does not crack; and, above all,
it does not, like amber varnish, split off the picture
on the slightest friction.</p>

<p>The application of this varnish is a very simple
matter. The negative is to be again placed on a
pneumatic plate holder, and the varnish is to be
poured on to the surface in precisely the same manner
as the Collodion was at the commencement of the
process, the superfluous quantity being returned to
the bottle: in a few moments the varnish will be
quite dry and hard, and the plate may be handled
with perfect safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>I may mention, as a precaution, in varnishing the
plate, that it is better to perform that operation in a
still atmosphere; as the solvent of the gum being
chloroform and very volatile, if it were conducted in
a current of air, there might be some difficulty in
obtaining an even coating to the picture.</p>

<p>In concluding this description of a process, which
is at once simple and certain, I would ask the
patient attention of those who may do me the honor
of repeating my experiments. I have endeavoured
to render the details of the process as intelligible
as possible, and if I have succeeded in advancing
the art of Photography only one step by so doing,
I consider that it is an ample return for hours
and days spent in anxious thought and laborious
experiment.</p>

<p>LARGER OR OTHER SIZES TO ORDER.</p>

<p>The advantages of a certain and simple Dry Collodion
Process are so obvious to those who have practised Photography
in the open air, that we feel it is merely necessary
to introduce the above list to their notice with as few
remarks as possible.</p>

<p>We would, however, mention a few particulars connected
with the process for the information of those who have not
hitherto practised the Dry Collodion process, as detailed
by Mr. Long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The plates as prepared for sale, are hermetically sealed
in an envelope perfectly impervious to air and moisture,
they can therefore be exported to any climate without risk
of deterioration.</p>

<p>Plates prepared by Mr. Long's process will keep sensitive
for almost an indefinite period, and can be developed at
any time without regard to the date of exposure; this, it
will be seen, is of immense advantage to the tourist, as
he can delay the development of the whole of his plates
until his return.</p>

<p>To those Photographers whose inclinations or want of
leisure will not admit of their carrying through the first
preparation of the plate, these Dry Sensitive Plates will be
found invaluable, enabling their whole energy to be directed
to the more careful selection of subject.</p>

<p>The plates being dry, there is no danger of dust settling
on their surfaces; this point will be appreciated by every
Photographer.</p>

<p>The development of the pictures can be conducted in
any room whence the light can be excluded&mdash;as the process
is simple and clean&mdash;three dishes being the only requisites
in point of apparatus.</p>

<p>To Officers, Engineers, and Architects, these Dry Plates
offer a desideratum of no small value, as they are <i>always
ready for use</i>, occupy very little room in travelling, and can
be used under circumstances which would preclude the
adoption of any process that had to be carried out on the
spot.</p>

<p class="caption3">DESCRIPTION AND DIRECTIONS FOR USE.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>No matter what process we employ to retain the sensitiveness
of our plates, it is most objectionable that the glasses
should be made to slide by their gravity from the plate-box
to the slide; for if we employ either honey, glycerine, or
oxymel as preservative agents, the chances are considerably
in favor of an amount of dust settling on the surface, the
dust being in a great part formed by the attrition of the
roughened edges of the plate against the plate-box. Another
inconvenience attending the use of a box when the plate has
to slide, is the danger that exists under that arrangement of
ripping the film from the edges of the plate by the friction
against the groove in the box which holds it. These may
appear very trivial matters, but they are nevertheless great
drawbacks to successful operations.</p>

<p>We may mention that the plan we are about to describe
is equally applicable to all Cameras of moderate size. We
will, however, take our description from the form of apparatus
adapted to a double lens Stereoscopic Camera.</p>

<p>The Camera (A) is furnished at its back with two wires (B).
On these wires slides the plate-box (C), which has previously
been fitted at its sides with two sockets (D). Just inside
the back of the Camera box is a spring (E), and on the top
of the Camera is a button (F), which secures the dark slide
in its place.</p>

<p>We now slide the box of prepared plates (C) on to the
wires (B), the lid of the box opening from the Camera; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
then stretch over the whole affair, the black light proof
covering (G); this completes the arrangement, and now for
the mode of operating.</p>

<p>The opaque covering is furnished at its side with two
elastic rings. Into these thrust the hands, so that the rings
may firmly encompass the wrist. Then open the plate-box,
and throw the lid quite back. Next unbutton the door of
the dark slide, and raise it until the spring (E) flies underneath
it, and retains it in a horizontal position. This we will presume
to be done with the right hand; the left hand being
engaged as soon as the door is opened, in holding the plate
that is already in the back in its place. The right hand
being now at liberty, comes to the assistance of the left, and
the plate that has undergone exposure is safely transferred to
the vacant groove in the plate-box. This accomplished, the
next plate is to be placed in the back, and the same operations
gone through in the inverse order, the left holding the plate
in its place, while the right releases the door from the influence
of the spring (E), and re-buttons it, leaving the plate
quite safe in the dark slide.</p>

<p>When we require to focus for a fresh picture, it is only
necessary to remove the dark covering from that part of the
Camera where the ground glass is placed. The picture can
be seen without removing the plate-box or the whole of the
covering.</p>

<p>It is obvious that there is no limit to the number of glasses
that can be taken to the field of operations. In this way,
several boxes holding a dozen each, can be strapped together
and placed on the Camera, one by one, as occasion or opportunity
may direct.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
